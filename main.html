  <h4 class="text-center" style="background-color:MediumSeaGreen;">Early life</h4><br>
<p>Satyendra Nath Bose was born into a middle class family on January 1, 1894 in British India’s capital city, Calcutta, Bengal Presidency.
Satyendra’s father was Surendranath Bose, an accountant in the East Indian Railway Company. Surendranath had a great interest in mathematics & science and in 1903 founded a small pharmaceutical and chemical company.</p> <img src="https://www.uq.edu.au/news//filething/get/120179/Bose.jpg"align="right">
<p>In 1907, at age 13, Satyendra began high school at the illustrious Hindu School. He was quickly recognized as an outstanding pupil, especially in mathematics and the sciences.By 1909, age 15,he began studying for science degree at Calcutta’s Presidency College.He majored in Applied Mathematics.</p>
  <h4 class="text-center" style="background-color:MediumSeaGreen;">Diving into Quantum statistics</h4><br>
  <p> On June 4, 1924, Bose sent his paper directly to Einstein, writing:</p>
 <p><em>“I have ventured to send you the accompanying article for your perusal and opinion. I am anxious to know what you think of it. You will see that I have tried to deduce the coefficient 8πν<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>3</sup> in Planck’s Law independent of the classical electrodynamics.”</em>
 
  </p>
  <p> Einstein replied to Bose on July 24, saying that Bose’s work was:
  </p>
  <p><em>“… an important step forward and I liked it very much.”</em>

  <h4 class="text-center" style="background-color:MediumSeaGreen;"> Bose-Einstein Condensate</h4><br>
  <p>The more Einstein thought about Bose’s paper, the more he was impressed by the possibilities it offered. He decided to apply Bose’s quantum statistics to a gas made of atoms to see what effects might be expected.</p>
  <p>This led to his prediction of the Bose–Einstein Condensate (BEC).
In a BEC each particle in a collection of particles exists in the same, identical quantum state – the particles are indistinguishable from one another.

    In took over 70 years from Einstein’s prediction of BECs for a pure single entity to be seen.</p><br>
